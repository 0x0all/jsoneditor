<h2>2013-02-09, version 2.0.0</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Implemented an action menu, replacing the action buttons on the right
        side of the editor and the inline action buttons. This gives a cleaner
        interface, more space for the actual contents, and more room for new
        controls (like insert and sort).</li>
    <li>Implemented shortcut keys. The JSON Editor can be used with just a
        keyboard.</li>
    <li>Implemented sort action, which sorts the childs of an array or
        object.</li>
    <li>Implemented auto scrolling up and down when dragging a node and reaching
        the top or bottom of the editor.</li>
    <li>Added support for CommonJS and RequireJS.</li>
    <li>Added more examples.</li>
    <li>Implemented a new mode 'form', in which only values are editable and the
        fields are fixed.</li>
    <li>Improved performance and memory usage.</li>
    <li>Minor improvements and bug fixes.</li>
</ul>


<h2>2012-12-08, version 1.7.0</h2>
<ul>

        the data and datastructure is read-only.</li>
    <li>Implemented methods set(json, name), setName(name), and getName(), which
        allows for setting and getting the field name of the root node.</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue where the search bar does not work when there is no
        global window.editor object.</li>
</ul>


<h2>2012-11-26, version 1.6.2</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug in the change callback handler, resulting in an infinite
        loop when requesting the contents of the editor inside the callback

        formatter changes.</li>
    <li>Changed the default indentation of the JSONFormatter to 4 spaces.</li>
    <li>Renamed options 'enableSearch' and 'enableHistory' to 'search' and
